# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi world, 

I'm just another engineering student working on learning and applying ML to different private and uni-related projects. Using github primarily as inspiration and to learn from the vast amount of knowledge available trough the community.

Thats all, thanks. 
Per HÃ¥kon.
